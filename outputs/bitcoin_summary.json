    "summary": "Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic cash system proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, enabling direct online payments between parties without financial intermediaries. It addresses the double-spending problem through a peer-to-peer network that timestamps transactions into a continuous chain using proof-of-work, making the transaction history immutable and secure as long as honest nodes control the majority of CPU power. The system uses digital signatures for ownership transfer and a timestamp server to ensure transaction chronology. Nodes in the network work on adding new blocks to the chain, and the longest chain represents the accepted history of transactions. The design inherently supports privacy by using anonymous public keys and offers incentives for nodes through new coin generation and transaction fees. The paper also discusses methods for reclaiming disk space, simplifying payment verification, and handling transaction values, all while maintaining security against potential attackers.",
